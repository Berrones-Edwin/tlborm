# The Little Book of Rust Macros

> **Note**: This is a continuation of [Daniel Keep's Book](https://github.com/DanielKeep/tlborm) which
has not been updated since the early summer of 2016, adapted to make use of
[mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

[View the rendered version](https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/).

This book is an attempt to distil the Rust community's collective knowledge of Rust macros,
`Macros by Example` to be precise.  As such, both additions (in the form of pull requests) and
requests (in the form of issues) are welcome.

The [original Little Book of Rust Macros](https://github.com/DanielKeep/tlborm) has helped me
immensely with understanding ***Macros by Example*** style macros while I was still learning the
language. Unfortunately, the author of the book has since left the project untouched, while the Rust
language as well as it's macro-system keeps evolving. Which is why I wanted to revive the project
and keep it up to date with current Rust helping other newcomers understand macros, a part of the
language a lot of people seem to have trouble with.

> This book expects you to have basic knowledge of Rust, it will not explain language features or
> constructs that are irrelevant to macros. Having read and understood the first seven chapters of
> the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) is a must, though having read the majority
> of the book is recommended.
