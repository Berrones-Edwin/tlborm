# The Little Book of Rust Macros

**Note**: This is a continuation of [Daniel Keep's Book](https://github.com/DanielKeep/tlborm) which has not been updated since the early summer of 2016.

This book is an attempt to distil the Rust community's collective knowledge of Rust macros.  As such, both additions (in the form of pull requests) and requests (in the form of issues) are welcome.

The [original Little Book of Rust Macros](https://github.com/DanielKeep/tlborm) has helped me immensely with understanding ***Macros by Example*** style macros while I was still learning the language. Unfortunately, the author of the book has since left the project untouched, while the Rust language as well as it's macro-system keeps evolving. Which is why I wanted to revive the project and keep it up to date with current Rust helping other newcomes to understand macros, a part of the language a lot of people are having trouble with, even though it is not that difficult to use once understood.
